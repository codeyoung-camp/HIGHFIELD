<p>At Highfield Preparatory school we offer an excellent education to all our pupils. Choosing the right school for your son or daughter is one of the most important decisions you will make.Highfield Prep is not an academically selective school. We pride ourselves on welcoming children of all abilities and fostering their individual talents so they can become the best they can be. We have boys and girls from Pre-School or Reception classes up to Year 2 and from Year 3 we are all girls.

Although we hope that our website and prospectus gives you a good flavour of our school, we would really encourage you to visit and we would be delighted to arrange a bespoke, individual tour with our Headteacher, Ms Wallace, and have the opportunity to see the school in action and meet the staff.

We would be delighted to welcome you to Highfield Preparatory school and show you why our school is a truly happy and unique place for pupils to learn!
